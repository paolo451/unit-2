1.1 - x = AB ⊕ notB

1.2 - x = not(A ⊕ B) * not(A + B)

1.3 - x = not((C + notB) * (B ⊕ A))

1.4 - x = not((B ⊕ C * A ⊕ B) + A ⊕ C)

**2.- Draw the diagram for the logic equations below:**

2.1 - Out1 = A + C + BD + (notB notD)

2.2 - Out2 = notB + (notC notD) + CD

2.3 - Out3 = B + notC + D

2.4 - Out4 = (notB notD) + (C notD) + (BCnotD) + (notB C) + A

**4.- Find the equation for the notification system for...***

The apartment below needs a notification system  that sends an SMS to the owner when:
a) Any of the two windows is open when the main door is locked,
b) The baranda’s door is open when the main door is locked,
c) The TV screen is ON when the washing machine and the dish washing machine are ON.
Add 2 more rules:
d) The lamp from the living room is on and the TV is off
e) The bathtub is full and the main door is unlocked

Having this basis:

Given number of variables, and in the sake of practicality, I used the Charlie Coleman K-Map online tool, and inputted the truth table, to get this result:

Having that, my equation for those 5 different situations turned out to be:

**(notTV x L) + (TV x WM) + (notW x MD) + (notMD x BT) + (MD x notB)**

It's to be noted, nonetheless, that this could've been done without the k-map and only using the initial notes. 

In the first line, we have windows open (0) and *(which is literally AND)* main door locked (1) -> notWindows * MainDoor = notW * MD

In the second line, we have baranda open (0) and main door locked (1) -> notBaranda * MainDoor = notB * MD

In the third line, we have TV on (1) and washing machines on as well (1) -> TV * WashingMachines = TV * WM

In the fourth line, we have lamp on (1) and TV off (0) -> notTV * Lamp = notTV * L

In the fifth line, we have baththub full (1) and main door unlocked (0) -> Bathtub * notMainDoor = BT * notMD

If we sum all of that, we get **(notW x MD) + (notB x MD) + (TV x WM) + (notTV x L) + (BT x notMD)**, which is the same result as before (but in a different order)
